Progress

The code has been finished, with most of the goals of the proposal being met. These include:
- Being able to add and remove tasks
- Viewing all entered tasks with nice formatting
- Exporting schedule to text file with nice formatting
- Saving tasks between runs
- Importing a schedule via text file

There were a few things I decided to change since then, such as:
- Tasks no longer store due date; this info was irrelevant to the program and can be added into the description if the user wishes
- Tasks do not have a "finish" method to clear them from the task list; this is instead handled outside the Task class

Everything works and all errors are handled properly.
